excerpt: tl;dr please don’t litter!

<p>
this place — i call it “party beach”, some call it “river’s bend” after the neighborhood above it — is really beautiful. i think we can all agree on that.
</p>

<p>
i think we can also agree that party beach is pretty dirty. trashed, in fact. it breaks my heart every time i go. there’s beer cans, solo cups, socks, towels; we even found two separate pairs of shoes.
</p>

<p>
what’s wrong with this? other than being ugly, whenever it rains, the litter near the shore gets washed into the Little Miami. hopefully none of us are bringing chemical pollutants, but all the physical detritus does a lot of damage to the ecosystem.
</p>

<p>
and when there’s enough damage, people will start to notice. they’ll wonder where all this stuff is coming from, and eventually track down party beach. they might start to control the land, limiting access in an effort to stop the litter. and none of us want those <a href="http://i.huffpost.com/gen/1529320/images/n-LESLIE-KNOPE-628x314.jpg">pesky parks people</a> messing with party beach.
</p>

<p>
also, hurting the environment is bad in itself. what’s it done to you, except give you an awesome river and an awesome beach? nobody likes seeing cans and bags everywhere when they’re trying to relax on the river.

<li>don’t litter.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>just don’t be part of the problem. this is the easiest thing you could do! and you don’t have to do anything more than this.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>bring a kroger bag or something and clean up a bit.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>next, what you can do is to bring a small grocery bag and put some trash in it and throw it away at the trail. it’ll be super easy to bring up, and every little bit helps.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>bring a few trash bags and some friends and spend some time picking up litter!
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>it’s more fun than it sounds, and it’s surprisingly quick to fill a bag because there’s so much trash.</li>
<li>bring work gloves and avoid picking up glass (unless you have a heavy-duty bag). to save space, crush cans and plastic bottles first.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>


<ol class="org-ol">
<li>if you must have a party, clean up after yourself.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>if you brought it in, you can take it out.</li>
</ul></li>

<li>i actually don’t think that we should leave no trace at party beach. lnt discourages graffiti, but i really like the graffiti on the wall.</li>
